## 👨‍💻 About This Simulation

This repository documents my completion of the **IT Architecture Job Simulation** in collaboration with **BCG Platinion**.

In this experience, I stepped into the role of an **IT Architect**, guiding SmartBank through a structured digital transformation journey — from architecture diagnosis to roadmap execution.

---

# 🏦 SmartBank Digital Transformation Case

## 🎯 Objective

Design a modular, scalable, and future-ready architecture strategy for a regional bank facing:

- Legacy core banking systems  
- High run-cost IT structure  
- Fragmented CRM landscape  
- Siloed data & manual reporting  
- Customer experience gaps  
- Limited innovation capacity  

---

# 🔍 Phase 1 – Architecture Assessment

## Key Themes Identified

- Heavy technical debt
- Point-to-point system integrations
- Data fragmentation across business units
- Disconnected digital channels
- Run-cost imbalance limiting innovation
- Legacy monolithic core systems
- Limited API exposure
- Batch-driven processing


## Executive Hypothesis

SmartBank’s issues were systemic — not isolated application failures.  
Transformation required coordinated modernization across:

- Core banking
- Integration layer
- Data architecture
- Customer experience layer
- IT operating model

---

# 📊 Task 2 – Pain Point Prioritization

Using structured evaluation based on **Impact, Scale, and Urgency**, I ranked key issues:

| Pain Point | Priority | Reason |
|------------|----------|--------|
| Legacy Core Instability | 🔴 High | Repeated P1 incidents & customer impact |
| Run-Cost Imbalance | 🔴 High | 68% run vs peer benchmark |
| Data Fragmentation | 🔴 High | Manual reporting & compliance risks |
| Customer Experience Gaps | 🟡 Medium | Onboarding friction & session failures |
| Risk & Fraud Capability Gaps | 🟡 Medium | Limited AI/ML readiness |

This phase reinforced structured prioritization and executive storytelling.

---

# 🧠 Task 3 – Solution Mapping & Scenario Modeling

## Pain Point → Architecture Solution

| Problem | Modernization Strategy |
|----------|-----------------------|
| Legacy Core | Cloud-native core replacement |
| CRM Fragmentation | Unified cloud CRM platform |
| Data Silos | Enterprise Data Lakehouse |
| CX Gaps | API-first omnichannel experience layer |
| IT Cost Inefficiency | Managed services transition |

---

# 🔮 Future Architecture Scenarios

## 🟢 GOOD – Tactical Stabilization
- Patch core instability
- Clean reporting pipelines
- Improve session reliability
- Minor cost optimizations  
Timeline: 12–18 months  

Tradeoff: Technical debt remains.

---

## 🟡 BETTER – Modular Modernization (Selected)

Scope:
- API-first integration layer
- CRM consolidation
- Enterprise Data Lakehouse
- Managed services shift

Benefits:
- Strong CX uplift
- Unified customer view
- Faster product releases
- Reduced run-cost ratio

Timeline: 18–30 months  

Tradeoff: Core banking remains legacy risk.

---

## 🔴 BEST – End-to-End Cloud-Native Transformation

Scope:
- Core banking replacement
- DevSecOps model
- Real-time architecture
- AI-driven risk & personalization

Timeline: 3–5 years  

Tradeoff: High investment & migration complexity.

---

# 🗺 Task 4 – Transformation Roadmap (Better Scenario)

## Phase 1 – Foundation & Stabilization (0–6 months)
- Stabilize CoreBank
- Establish API standards
- Launch managed services transition  

Output: Reduced incident volume & approved architecture blueprint  

---

## Phase 2 – Data & CRM Modernization (6–15 months)
- Implement Enterprise Data Lakehouse
- Consolidate CRM platform
- Establish Single Customer View  

Output: Trusted reporting & unified data governance  

---

## Phase 3 – Omnichannel Experience Transformation (12–24 months)
- Launch API-first digital platform
- Rebuild mobile & web channels
- Enable digital onboarding  

Output: Improved NPS & faster onboarding  

---

## Phase 4 – Optimization & Innovation Enablement (24–30 months)
- Deploy AI-driven fraud capabilities
- Implement DevSecOps & CI/CD
- Retire redundant legacy systems  

Output: Innovation acceleration & reduced run-cost ratio

# 🚆 Case Study Inspiration – Deutsche Bahn (Next Generation Timetabling)

The simulation also referenced a large-scale transformation example:

- 3,000 trains daily across 33,500 km
- 1M+ yearly orders
- Manual timetabling taking 72 hours
- Transitioned to 5-minute fully digitized process
- 100% end-to-end automation
- 6B € savings vs infrastructure expansion
- Zero scheduling conflicts

Key Takeaway:
Cloud-native, Agile, DevOps-driven delivery organizations can unlock massive operational efficiency and scalability.

# 💡 Core Learning

Enterprise Architecture is about enabling business strategy through structured system design.

Successful digital transformation requires balancing:

- Stability vs Innovation  
- Cost vs Scalability  
- Speed vs Governance  
- Technical ambition vs Organizational readiness  

Architecture decisions must always tie back to measurable business impact.
